Hi, I'm Lee Zong Han 👋
Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a Full Stack Engineer passionate about building tools that enhance people's lives. I started experimenting with coding in 2022, and what started as simple scripting has now evolved into a career that spans fintech, startups, and beyond.

👨‍💻 What I Do
I'm currently working at TransAsia Private Capital where I build backend tools that streamline workflows and make life a little easier for my colleagues. My focus is on improving the efficiency of back-office operations, making sure our systems run smoothly.

Along the way, I've also had the opportunity to help shape Capata, a joint-venture supply chain financing platform. I’ve worked closely with partners to translate business needs into technical solutions, bridging the gap between ideas and reality.

Some Tools and Technologies I Use:
React
Node.js
MongoDB
Docker
AWS
Tailwind CSS
🛠 Projects I've Worked On
Investment Management Platform
A full-featured back-office management system designed for loan booking, real-time user logging, and portfolio management. It’s secure, responsive, and built with scalability in mind.

🌱 What I’m Learning
I’m always looking to grow and learn more about full stack development, but I also enjoy exploring new technologies like AI and blockchain. I’m fascinated by how these tools are shaping the future and hope to work on projects that integrate these areas more deeply.
